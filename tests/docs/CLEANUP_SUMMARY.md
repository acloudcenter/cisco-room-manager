# Test Directory Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

### Redundant Connection Test Files

- `tests/connection-test.js` - Superseded by environment variable tests
- `tests/debug-connection.js` - No longer needed since WebSocket is working
- `tests/http-api-test.js` - HTTP fallback not needed with working WebSocket
- `tests/simple-http-test.js` - Basic connectivity test no longer needed
- `tests/test-http-connector.js` - HTTP connector test not needed
- `tests/test-websocket-enabled.js` - Functionality covered by other tests
- `tests/working-connection.js` - Redundant with current tests

### Unused Services

- `src/services/http-api-connector.ts` - HTTP fallback connector not needed

### Documentation Consolidation

- `tests/enable-websocket-guide.md` - Information moved to main README

## Files Kept

### Essential Connection Tests

- `tests/services/test-single-device.ts` - Basic connection test with env vars
- `tests/services/test-connection-cleanup.ts` - Connection cleanup verification

### Framework Tests

- `tests/components/` - React component tests
- `tests/stores/` - State management tests
- `tests/utils/` - Test utilities
- `tests/__mocks__/` - Mock implementations
- `tests/setup.ts` - Test configuration

### Documentation

- `tests/README.md` - Updated with current test structure
- `tests/CONNECTION_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - WebSocket best practices guide
- `tests/TEST_SUMMARY.md` - Test framework summary

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Complexity** - Fewer files to maintain
2. **Clear Purpose** - Each remaining test has a specific role
3. **Environment Security** - All connection tests use .env variables
4. **No Redundancy** - Eliminated duplicate functionality
5. **Focused Testing** - Two clear connection tests: basic + cleanup

## Current Test Structure

```

├── services/
│   ├── test-single-device.ts        # Basic connection test
│   └── test-connection-cleanup.ts   # Cleanup verification

```

The test directory is now clean, focused, and maintainable!
